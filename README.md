# Train-Scheduler
Basic Train Schedule

Train Scheduler

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, FireBase

This project is a train scheduler application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The application will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
It will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions

1. The project allows the user to add in train details, that would be saved in Firebase Db.

2. The next arrival time, and time left to next train are calculated and displayed.

3. The user is also allowed to delete or edit the train details.

4. The user will be authenticated using FirebaseUI Widget, using email and password.
   Guests could use the email:guest@gmail.com, password as values to login.


Pending (Extra Challenges)

* Consider updating your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).
